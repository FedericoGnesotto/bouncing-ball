# bouncing-ball

A repository for a pygame-implemented game. 
A ball is created on the screen with a random velocity direction. At the bottom of the screen a horizontal bar is created.
Goal of the game is not to let the ball fall below the bar. The ball should bounce off the bar, the vertical walls and the upper wall.
